        <ul>
          <li><a href=http://kroffo.github.io/PHY437>Advanced Quantum Mechanics (PHY 437)</a></li>
            Basic principles of wave mechanics, theory of angular momentum, applications to physical systems.

          <li><a href=http://ironkladd.github.io/rakushki>Software Engineering (CSC 380)</a></li>
            In this course I worked in a team with 4 other students to design and develop a game, which we call rakushki.

          <li><a href=http://kroffo.github.io/CSC221Notes>Foundations of Computer Science (CSC 221)</a></li>
            Course Description: This course will provide students with a broad perspective of computer science and will acquaint them with various formal systems on which modern computer science is based. Students will study the structure and interpretation of four classes of abstract computing machines.

          <li><a href=http://kroffo.github.io/MAT330>Introduction to Algebra (MAT 330)</a></li>
            Groups and their fundamental properties, permutation groups, cyclic groups, subgroups, Lagrange's theorem, and homomorphisms and isomorphisms of groups.

          <li><a href=http://kroffo.github.io/MAT320>Numerical Analysis (MAT 320)</a></li>
            Representation of numbers and errors; methods for the solution of nonlinear equations; numerical integration; interpolation and polynomial approximation; numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations; numerical solutions of systems of equations. Emphasizes efficient programming techniques and the mathematics associated with numerical methods.
