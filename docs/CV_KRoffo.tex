\section*{Professional Experience}
\textbf{Software Engineer - NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory} \hfill June 2017 - Present

My first role at JPL was to develop tools for InSight, a Mars Lander. I joined the team in June 2017 to build modeling software for surface operations. I witnessed the launch from Vandenberg on May 5, 2018, and was in the surface operations room for landing on November 26, 2018. I worked with my team to determine what the lander would do each day on Mars, using the tools I developed over the year and a half before landing. Since working on InSight I have been contributing to the development of a multimission suite of tools for developing, simulating and packaging mission plans. This \href{https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie}{open-sourced} effort is pushing forward our capabilities for operating our space craft, bringing our technology in this area into the modern era. See \href{http://www.oswegocountynewsnow.com/news/mars-landing-puts-phoenix-native-suny-oswego-grad-roffo-among/article_968bd574-f34c-11e8-8c5b-b7d557e9f682.html?fbclid=IwAR1iCW3CdQIRr2JIy1f96utXjzzidSJ6vA13jVgvkjKIU6PopaLHYkpbQrw}{here} for an article about my role on InSight.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Software Engineer - NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory}\\
  The Deep Space Network consists of multiple antennae on Earth which communicate with space craft beyond the moon. In order to improve this process, NASA software engineers are developing a new software to generate files read by the antennae, however they must check that the new software does not generate files with errors. My project at JPL was to develop a diff tool using node.js which would compare these files, and display differences, which the users could flag as unimportant differences, or more imporantly find defects in the products of their software.\\

\section*{Research Experience}
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{An Asteroseismic Analysis of the Red Giant Branch Bump}\\
As an intern in \href{http://www.mps.mpg.de/sage}{SAGE} at Max-Planck Institute for Solar System Research in G{\"o}ttingen, Germany I studied how asterosesmic parameters were effected during the RGB bump. I used the MESA
stellar evolution code to generate tracks of models of stars with varying masses, then used ADIPLS to calculate the frequencies they would output as the stars passed through the
bump.\\
Advisors: \textbf{Saskia Hekker, Earl Bellinger, George Angelou} \hfill June 2016 - Present

\item \href{https://kroffo.github.io/docs/thesis.pdf}{\textbf{The Application of Abstract Algebra to Twisty Puzzles}}\\
Rubik's Cubes have fascinated mathematicians ever since they made their debut in the 1970s. Since then, many differently shaped and sized variants of the Rubik's Cube (called twisty puzzles) have become available. In this research I applied concepts I learned in Abstract Algebra to describe these fascinating puzzles. I also worked on a design for a \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17ll6TWm45M}{puzzle which I have created}, and 3D-printed thanks to SUNY Oswego's SCAC grant.\\
Advisors: \textbf{Bonita Graham, David Vampola} \hfill Fall 2014 - Fall 2016

\item \textbf{Fourier Decomposition Analysis of CSTAR RR Lyrae Variable Stars}\\
I began this research through a 6 week visit to India in summer 2014. My original, and now completed, goal was to determine the metallicities of several RR Lyrae variable stars.\\
Advisor: \textbf{Shashi Kanbur} \hfill Summer 2014 - Spring 2015
