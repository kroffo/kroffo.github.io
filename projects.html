      <h2> Projects </h2>
        Here are some projects I have worked on by myself. These were not made for a class, but for fun!
        <ul>
          <li><a href=http://kroffo.github.io/Jeopardy>LaTeX Jeopardy</a></li>
            A LaTeX version of Jeopardy I made with help from discussions online, and the OCGX package.
        </ul>
