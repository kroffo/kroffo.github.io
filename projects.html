        Here are some projects I have worked on by myself. These were
        not made for a class, but for fun!

      <p class="description">
      As president of the SUNY Oswego Math Club, I wanted to plan a
      game night for students and professors. One of the core ideas
      for the game night was to play Math Jeopardy, but I didn't like
      any of the Jeopardy games I found online. I was learning LaTeX,
      so I thought it would be a good exercise to make my own
      Jeopardy game in LaTeX!
      </p>
      <p class="description">
      I was able to create this version of Jeopardy with help from
      online discussion boards, and the OCGX package.

        Upon completing the text-based game made during my CSC-241
        course, I decided to go ahead and make a much more
        thrilling version of the game. Project BACK is a text-based
        game in which the player moves between rooms, finding keys,
        armor, weapons and creatures. The player must unlock
        chests and doors, equip armor and weapons, and battle enemies
        on a quest to reach the Heaven Room, where the game is won.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        The mechanics of the game are all written in Java, but
        the coolest part is that to create a different world with
        different creatures, rooms and items, none of the programming
        must be changed! The world is loaded through an xml file, and
        to create your own version of the game all you need to do
        is follow the guidelines in creating your own xml file.
