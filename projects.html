        Here are some projects I have worked on by myself. These were
        not made for a class, but for fun!

      As president of the SUNY Oswego Math Club, I wanted to plan a
      game night for students and professors. One of the core ideas
      for the game night was to play Math Jeopardy, but I didn't like
      any of the Jeopardy games I found online. I was learning LaTeX,
      so I thought it would be a good exercise to make my own
      Jeopardy game in LaTeX!
      </p>
      <p class="description">
      I was able to create this version of Jeopardy with help from
      online discussion boards, and the OCGX package.

      <p class="description">
        Upon completing the text-based game made during my CSC-241
        course, I decided to go ahead and make a much more
        thrilling version of the game. Project BACK is a text-based
        game in which the player moves between rooms, finding keys,
        armor, weapons and creatures. The player must unlock
        chests and doors, equip armor and weapons, and battle enemies
        on a quest to reach the Heaven Room, where the game is won.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        The mechanics of the game are all written in Java, but
        the coolest part is that to create a different world with
        different creatures, rooms and items, none of the programming
        must be changed! The world is loaded through an xml file, and
        to create your own version of the game all you need to do
        is follow the guidelines in creating your own xml file.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Eventually I turned this text based game into an actual video game
        as my final project when I took Game Programming. I never
        got the chance to make sprites, so graphically the game looks
        like a bunch of squares moving around through rooms, but
        the game is playable, and perhaps even a little fun!

      <p class="description">
        While in Germany for an Astrophysics internship in the summer
        of 2016 I decided I wanted to make a gravity based game.
        Though it is incomplete, it is possible to play what I have made.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        The project was written in Java using the LibGDX game engine. The
        player can place masses, and gravity will pull them towards each other.
        I have plans to make levels on which the player must place a mass with an
        initial velocity so that fixed masses will pull it around obstacles
        into some goal zone.
