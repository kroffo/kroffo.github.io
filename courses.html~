          <li><a href=.>Advanced Quantum Mechanics (PHY 437)</a></li>
            Basic principles of wave mechanics, theory of angular momentum, applications to physical systems. 
          <li><a href=.>Advanced Mechanics (PHY 436)</a></li>
            The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics; applications to satellite and rigid body motion. Relativistic mechanics.
          <li><a href=.>Software Engineering (CSC 380)</a></li>
            Techniques for developing large software systems are presented. Formal and semiformal languages for specification and design of software, verification, and configuration management techniques are discussed.
          <li><a href=.>Foundations of Computer Science (CSC 221)</a></li>
            This course will provide students with a broad perspective of computer science and will acquaint them with various formal systems on which modern computer science is based. Students will study the structure and interpretation of four classes of abstract computing machines.
          <li><a href=.>Introduction to Algebra (MAT 330)</a></li>
            Groups and their fundamental properties, permutation groups, cyclic groups, subgroups, Lagrange's theorem, and homomorphisms and isomorphisms of groups. Introduction to rings.
          <li><a href=.>Numerical Analysis (MAT 320)</a></li>
            Representation of numbers and errors; methods for the solution of nonlinear equations; numerical integration; interpolation and polynomial approximation; numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations; numerical solutions of systems of equations. Emphasizes efficient programming techniques and the mathematics associated with numerical methods.
