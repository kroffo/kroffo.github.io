          Hello! My name is Kenny Roffo, and I am an undergraduate
          at SUNY Oswego completing three majors: Physics, Mathematics and Computer
          Science. I am in fifth year at Oswego.
          Some of the notable things I've done during my college career include:
          <ul>
            <li>Astrophysics research of RR Lyrae variable stars at Delhi University in India (Summer 2014)</li>
            <li>Software Engineering internship at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Summer 2015) </li>
            <li>Asteroseismology research of the red giant branch bump at Max-Planck Institute for Solar System Research (Summer 2016)</li>
            <li>Mathematics research on Rubik's Cube and other twisty puzzles, including inventing my own puzzle,
              picture on the right above. This was for my Honors Thesis at SUNY Oswego. (Fall 2015 - Fall 2016)</li>
        </p>
        Currently I am doing a software engineering co-op at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
        and after that I will complete one final semester at SUNY Oswego before graduating in May 2017.
        <p class="plainText">
          Some of my hobbies involve playing guitar, playing video
          games with friends, and collecting and solving Rubik's
          cubes! I currently have around 100 Rubik's cube-like puzzles!
