Hello! My name is Kenny Roffo, and I am an undergraduate at SUNY Oswego completing
three majors: Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science. I am in fifth year at
Oswego. Some of the notable things I've done during my college career include:

- Astrophysics research of RR Lyrae variable stars at Delhi University in India
(Summer 2014)
- Software Engineering internship at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
(Summer 2015)
- Asteroseismology research of the red giant branch bump at Max-Planck Institute
for Solar System Research (Summer 2016) [Poster]({{ site.baseurl }}/posters/MPS-Poster.pdf)
- Mathematics research on Rubik's Cube and other twisty puzzles, including
inventing my own puzzle, pictured on the right above. This was for my [Honors
Thesis]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/thesis.pdf) at SUNY Oswego. (Fall 2015 - Fall 2016)

Currently I am doing a software engineering co-op at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, and after that I will complete one final semester at SUNY Oswego
before graduating in May 2017.

Some of my hobbies involve playing guitar, playing video games with friends, and
collecting and solving Rubik's cubes! I currently have around 100 Rubik's
cube-like puzzles!
