Hello! My name is Kenny Roffo, and I am a Software Engineer at NASA
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I am currently working on flight software
for an upcoming mission to Jupiter to study Europa. In addition, I
split my time to work on a discrete event simulator for modeling our
spacecraft activities before transmission. I am also working slowly at
earning my Master's degree in Computer Science through Johns Hopkins
Whiting School of Engineering to strengthen my expertise. Before coming to
JPL, I earned a Bachelors of Science at SUNY Oswego completing three
majors: Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science. Some of the notable things
I did during my college career include:

- Astrophysics research of RR Lyrae variable stars at Delhi University in India
(Summer 2014)
- Software Engineering internship at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
(Summer 2015)
- Asteroseismology research of the red giant branch bump at Max-Planck Institute
for Solar System Research (Summer 2016) [Poster]({{ site.baseurl }}/posters/MPS-Poster.pdf)
- Mathematics research on Rubik's Cube and other twisty puzzles, including
inventing my own puzzle, pictured on the right above. This was for my [Honors
Thesis]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/thesis.pdf) at SUNY Oswego. (Fall 2015 - Fall 2016)

When I'm not at work, I have several hobbies I devote my time to. First and foremost,
I am a gamer. Video games allow me to stay in touch with friends from back home in
upstate New York, and allow me to keep my brain active while not at work, constantly
working to solve puzzles or develop effective strategies to overcome my opponents.
I also enjoy playing guitar, where I largely focus on metal and rock. One of the most
interesting hobbies of mine is collecting and solving Rubik's cubes! I have around 100
Rubik's cube-like puzzles, including one which I personally invented and 3D printed
for a research project in college. The Roffo Cube is pictured below.
