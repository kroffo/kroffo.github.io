Hello! My name is Kenny Roffo, and I am a Software Engineer at NASA
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. My main project at work is focused on the
development of a discrete event simulation system for modeling
spacecraft activities before they are uplinked for execution. Before
coming to JPL, I earned a Bachelors of Science at SUNY Oswego
completing three majors: Physics, Mathematics and Computer
Science. Some of the notable things I did during my college career
include:

- Astrophysics research of RR Lyrae variable stars at Delhi University in India
(Summer 2014)
- Software Engineering internship at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
(Summer 2015)
- Asteroseismology research of the red giant branch bump at Max-Planck Institute
for Solar System Research (Summer 2016) [Poster]({{ site.baseurl }}/posters/MPS-Poster.pdf)
- Mathematics research on Rubik's Cube and other twisty puzzles, including
inventing my own puzzle, pictured on the right above. This was for my [Honors
Thesis]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/thesis.pdf) at SUNY Oswego. (Fall 2015 - Fall 2016)

When I'm not at work, I am surely spending time with my lovely wife
Lexi, and our toddler Layla. I also enjoy playing video games as well
as playing guitar. I've had many other hobbies over the years, the
most interesting of which is collecting and solving Rubik's
cubes! I have around 100 Rubik's cube-like puzzles, including one
which I personally invented and 3D printed for a research project in
college. The Roffo Cube is pictured below.
