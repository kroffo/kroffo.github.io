Hello! My name is Kenny Roffo, and I am a Software Engineer at NASA
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I am currently working on activity modeling
for the InSight Mars Lander, set to Launch on May 5, 2017. Before coming to
JPL, I earned a Bachelors of Science at SUNY Oswego completing three
majors: Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science. Some of the notable things
I did during my college career include:

- Astrophysics research of RR Lyrae variable stars at Delhi University in India
(Summer 2014)
- Software Engineering internship at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
(Summer 2015)
- Asteroseismology research of the red giant branch bump at Max-Planck Institute
for Solar System Research (Summer 2016) [Poster]({{ site.baseurl }}/posters/MPS-Poster.pdf)
- Mathematics research on Rubik's Cube and other twisty puzzles, including
inventing my own puzzle, pictured on the right above. This was for my [Honors
Thesis]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/thesis.pdf) at SUNY Oswego. (Fall 2015 - Fall 2016)

When I'm not at work, I spend time with my love girlfriend, Nina, and work towards achieving
a set of personal goals for myself. Some of these goals include:
 - Improve my skills at playing guitar
 - Learn how to record and master music
 - Work on personal coding projects, including a video game I'm working on called Wilson
 
Since graduating college, I have tried to be organized about my goals, and I am making sure
to work towards reaching them every day. However, I still need some time to relax, so I have
some hobbies for fun as well! As you may have gathered, I enjoy playing guitar. I also like
to play video games with friends or by myself; However the most interesting hobby of mine is
collecting and solving Rubik's cubes! I have around 100 Rubik's cube-like puzzles, including
one which I personally invented and 3D printed for a research project in college. The Roffo Cube
is pictured at the top of this page.
